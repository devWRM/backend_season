# Getting Started with the Season app

HOW TO START THE APP
Install: ruby 2.7.1. , rails 6.0.4.1 , react 17.0.2 , npm 6.14.6 
Download: backend_season and frontend_season
In the command line:
- cd into backend_auserv2
- run: rails s
- cd into frontend_auserv2
- run:  npm start       
        Y

If the back end  was started first it's running on port 3000.
So the front end should automatically open on port 3001.
If it doesn't, open a browser and enter the URL address:    http://localhost:3001
